INFRASTRUCTURE
</font>

<br>
</font>
<font size=5>
Yashshrri has always followed an out of the box approach towards everything we do thus we have adopted a different approach towards our classrooms and facilities.
Our campus is large, airy with beautifully - maintained garden, lawn covered play areas and purposefully decorated spaces.
Our class rooms are made from modified shipping containers that are insulated and air conditioned keeping in mind the right temperature for children.
Our extensive campus enables free movement of the kids which keeps them happy and fresh.

Generally, students come to school with their parents but we do provide references of qualified vendors that have been ferrying Yashshrri’s students for years to help parents who require such a facility. For list of time - tested vendors, kindly speak to our center in-charge.
